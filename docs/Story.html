    <p>For preventing the children of poor people in Ireland, from
        being a burden on their parents or country, and for making
        them beneficial to the publick </p>

            <p>It is a melancholy object to those, who walk through this great town,
                or travel in the country, when they see the streets, the roads, and
                cabbin-doors crowded with beggars of the female sex, followed by three,
                four, or six children, all in rags, and importuning every passenger for
                an alms. These mothers, instead of being able to work for their honest
                livelihood, are forced to employ all their time in stroling to beg
                sustenance for their helpless infants who, as they grow up, either turn
                thieves for want of work, or leave their dear native country, to fight
                for the Pretender in Spain, or sell themselves to the Barbadoes.</p>
